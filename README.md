### thonpy

This project aims to help people with limited english language understanding code.

# Translation
If you want other languages to be available, you can visit the project's [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/thonpy)
There are some languages that were pre-machine-translated, but I won't add them if there isn't someone who actually reviews them.

# Status
Currently only built-in functions are supported, anything library-related is not.
There might be support for popular libraries later...
